        <h3 class="abt">About</h3>
        <p class="tribute-info">After emerging through Sevilla's youth academy and spending two seasons with the senior side, 
            Ramos moved to Real Madrid in the summer of 2005. Since then, he went on to become a mainstay for Real Madrid, 
            and had won 22 major honours, including five La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, becoming one of La Liga's top goalscorers from a defensive position. 
            He played a crucial part in the build-up to all four UEFA Champions League wins, being named in the competition Squad of the Season each time.
             He also scored the equaliser in the 93rd minute of the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final. <br /><br />
             Ramos has been named to the FIFPro World11 eleven times; a record for a defender, and the third-most all-time. He has also been elected to the UEFA Team of the Year nine times, 
             also a record for a defender and the third-most of any player. Additionally, Ramos has been named La Liga's Best Defender a record five times, and to the La Liga Team of the Season in 2015–16.
              In 2021, he joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer.

        <h3 class="abt">club career</h3>
            <h4 class="abt">sevilla &#58;</h4>
                <p class="tribute-info">In the 2004–05 season, Ramos appeared in 41 games as Sevilla finished sixth and qualified to the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, scoring in home fixtures against Real Sociedad (2–1)and Real Madrid (2–2).
                    In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, he scored his first continental goal,heading to conclude a 2–0 win over C.D. Nacional at the Ramon Sánchez Pizjuán in the first round (4–1 aggregate).

            <h4 class="abt">real madrid &#58;</h4>
                <p class="tribute-info">During his first seasons, Ramos played as centre back, being also used as an emergency defensive midfielder on occasion. However, with the arrival of Christoph Metzelder and Pepe in the 2007–08 season, 
                    he was again relocated to right back. In his first four seasons at Real Madrid, Ramos displayed a goalscoring instinct unusual to many defenders, netting more than 20 goals overall. He also received the first nine of his 24 red cards for the club, 
                    including four in his debut season. His first red card came after two bookable offences in a 1–0 away loss to Espanyol on 18 September 2005

                <p class="tribute-info">
                    Ramos' first goal of the season was a header in his first Champions League match of the campaign, against Club Brugge on 1 October at home. 
                    The goal came at a vital time as Real Madrid were 2–0 down by half-time but were able to make a comeback after another header by Casemiro. 
                    This was also Ramos' first Champions League goal in two seasons. On 30 October, Ramos scored from the penalty-spot in a 5–0 home victory over Leganés, 
                    continuing his run of scoring in 16 straight La Liga seasons, again equalling Messi.[98] One week later, on 6 November, Ramos scored his first penalty in the Champions League, 
                    which came against Galatasaray in a 6–0 home win. It was another 'Panenka' style penalty and also meant that Ramos scored in two Champions League group matches in the same season for the first time.
                    On 18 December, Ramos played in his 43rd El Clasico, claiming the all-time appearance record for this historic fixture

                <p class="tribute-info">
                    On 16 June, Real Madrid announced that Ramos would leave the club after 16 years. During his farewell event on the next day, Ramos, who had initially asked for a two-year offer, 
                    mentioned that he accepted a one-year contract renewal with a salary reduction;however, the offer had expired without his knowledge

                <h4 class="abt">Paris Saint German &#58;</h4>
                    <p class="tribute-info">
                        On 8 July 2021, it was announced that Ramos had signed a two-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain. He chose to wear the number 4 jersey, with Thilo Kehrer switching to the number 24 shirt. 
                        Ramos remarked: "I am quite superstitious about it and I love the number 4 because I have worn that number since the start of my career and it has followed me throughout my career and my life, 
                        bringing with much luck and many victories." During the medical examination required to complete the signing, the medical staff at PSG were reported to be impressed by his seriousness and physique, 
                        whilst the medical results were noted to be excellent and incredible. The staff compared Ramos' physique to that of a 25-year-old (he was 35 at the time).
